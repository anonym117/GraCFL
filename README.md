# GraphReachability

Cilk Plus can be enabled using the -fcilkplus flag.

Several g++ versions support cilk plus. In jupiter and earth machines, I have a singularity image that supports cilk plus. Use the following command to use the image: 

```
singularity shell --nv ~/ucr-singularity-ml-software-master-latest.simg
```
# Out of Core (occ)
To run the out of core version of the algorithm (ooc.cpp), create two directory named "log" and "possible" (without the quotes) inside the repository directory CFL-Reachability.
If this directories already exists, no need to create them.
